# Introduction

This wizard is a Desktop Installer that makes deploying and managing your own Bitcoin+LND node, and configuring as your [Lightning.Page](https://My.Lightning.Page) server, as simple as a few clicks. 

There are automatic builds for most operating systems:
- ~~[MacOS](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases)~~ Mac wanted
- [Windows](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases)
- [Linux](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases) (*headless systems should follow the API readme*)

Lightning.Page utilizes [ShockAPI](https://github.com/shocknet/api) which comes configured with this package. The wizard supports both Neutrino and Bitcoin Core.

*Full Bitcoin Core installations should budget at least 400GB of disk space*

Windows users should install "as Administrator"
