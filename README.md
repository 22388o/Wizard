# Introduction

<span style="color: #f5a623;">**NOTE: This project is in alpha, and is not intended for use on Mainnet**</span>

ShockWizard is a Desktop Installer that makes deploying and managing your own Bitcoin+LND node, and configuring as your [ShockWallet](https://github.com/shocknet/wallet) server, as simple as a few clicks. 

There are automatic builds for most operating systems:
- [MacOS](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases)
- [Windows](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases)
- [Linux](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases) (*headless systems should follow the API readme*)

ShockWallet utilizes [ShockAPI](https://github.com/shocknet/api) which comes configured with this package. The wizard supports both Neutrino and Bitcoin Core.



# Install

Browse to [Releases](https://github.com/shocknet/Wizard/releases) and download->run the correct file for your operating system. 

*Full Bitcoin Core installations should budget at least 400GB of disk space*


# Using with ShockWallet
The end of the wizard will provide you with a scan-able QR code. Scan with ShockWallet to automatically connect, this method will configure the app to automatically switch between your internal and external* IP addresses when you leave your home network.

**Port `9835` is used by default and may require a Firewall/NAT Forwarding Rule to be set on your router.*
